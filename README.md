# μshare
originally meant to be mushare (music share) but I realized μshare looks cooler

## running
install yt-dlp in root of project, and ffmpeg globally.
run node index.js, and go to http://localhost:3000

## Warning
This does allow arbitrary file downloads on the server, so use with caution. I am not responsible for any accidents resulting of this.
